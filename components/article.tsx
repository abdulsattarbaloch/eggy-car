          Eggy Car is a peculiar and funny game that is based on physics, where
          players have to drive the car with an egg on top over zig-zag tracks.
          It is an animated game. Balance of the car is key in this challenge,
          with more speed, and the condition is to save the egg during the drive
          on tricky roads. The falling of the egg is the end of the game. Eggy
          Car drives checks your reflexes, nerve system, and control of diving
          without breaking the egg. The animated style car game has different
          visuals, single-click control, and challenging tracks. The player has
          to collect coins on the way to get new cars without falling off the
          spaces. It tests the patience, accuracy, and timing. That is why it is
          an addictive game for the players. The design of the game is so simple
          that it is free to play on a browser and a mobile device for casual
          players. The main objective of the player is to remain on track as
          soon as possible for a long time, avoiding cracking the egg on tricky
          patches.
